Create a class BookCollection which contains:
    1. the owner's name and an array of books that the owner has,
    2. toString( ) that outputs all the books in the BookCollection in a nice format.
    3. a method hasBook(Book b) which checks if the book b is contained in the array (we consider two books the same if they have the same title and author).
    4. a method sort() that sorts the books in the array by the lexicographical order of the book title, and author.
Create your own BookCollection and check if you own a particular book:"Java in depth". Sort the BookCollection
and output the BookCollection.
